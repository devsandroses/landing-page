Landing Page Project by Meredith

Thank you for visiting my project. This is where my comulative skills from the previous HTML, CSS and Flexbox lessons are put to the test! 

In this project, I am creating a landing page from scratch, based off a design provided by the instructors at the Odin Project. 

I will add my thoughts once completed!

Whew! I completed the landing page project! 

It look me several days - one day where I created the HTML, a second day where I created the structure of the CSS and then two other days of tweaking it. 

I referred to the previous assignments to jog my memory of what I needed to do to get a certain result. 

I am figuring it out by trial and error. I did some googling for things that were not covered in previous lessons such as the rounded corners. The assignment page said the point was not to get it pixel perfect - but to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest, and I think I achieved that!
